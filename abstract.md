# Artifact for "Stir: Statical Type Inference for Incomplete Programs"

Stir is a novel two-stage approach for inferring types in incomplete programs that may be ill-formed, where whole-program syntactic analysis often fails. In the first stage, Stir predicts a type tag for each token by using neural networks, and consequently, infers all the simple types in the program. In the second stage, Stir refines the complex types for the tokens with predicted complex type tags. Unlike existing machine-learning-based approaches, which solve type inference as a classification problem, Stir reduces it to a sequence-to-graph parsing problem. This artifact contains the implementation and evaluation program of Stir, which can be used to reproduce the evaluation results, and can also serve as a standalone application for general use of the approach.
